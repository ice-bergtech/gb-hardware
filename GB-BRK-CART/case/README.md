# BG-BRK-CART case model

This folder contains the files used to 3d print the case for the breakout cart.
It consists of the bottom, with a normal GB cart footprint and the top, which is shorter to allow clearence for the breakout pins.

## gbcase

3D-printable case for homebrew GameBoy cartridges

Couldn't find any open-source one, only hundreds of closed-sources shitty ones. So I wasted an hour and a half reverse-engineering an existing cartridge and making this.

Have fun kids.
